I looked at a bunch of options, but eventually settled on the aptly name [react-markdown package](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown).\r\n\r\nI was also able to find a really good series of videos on youtube and sat down to put what I could into place.\r\n\r\nIt was a really interesting and practical piece, as I can actually see the benefit of using this methodology instead of other `RSS feed` based alternatives.\r\n\r\nI'm now debating as to whether or not to implement it on this site, instead of using traditional `.tsx` files with mark-up.\r\n"},{"id":1649286000,"title":"AWS Amplify\r","author":"Ian\r","date":"April 07, 2022\r","icon":"bi-cloud\r","image":"No image given","content":"\r\nI wanted to get an AWS instance up and running, as quickly as possible. So I have used AWS Amplify to power this project. At the moment, I have it set to build and deploy from my github instance and apart from some 'minor' issues in the beginning, it has been fairly pain free.\r\n\r\nThere are some great tutorials on setting up testing as part of the deploy process so that will probably be where I begin to focus my time in the near future.\r\n\r\nRight now I just want to add some more 'content' and get it working smoothly as a process.\r\n"},{"id":1646611200,"title":"Welcome\r","author":"Ian\r","date":"March 07, 2022\r","icon":"bi-house\r","image":"No image given","content":"\r\nThis is my little play pen for ReactJs and AWS hobby projects.

The buzz from hitting `F5` on a browser and seeing a working website appear has never left me and nor do I ever want it to.\r\n\r\nIn my previous role I was more than happy to implement designs and get projects up and running visually, even doing the ‘admin’ stuff of pipelines, authentication and global load balancing too. I was challenged by some designs and had a great working relationship with the UX designers we had onboard. But there was always an expectation to do server-side stuff too, despite being relied on for my input and SME on front-end issues.\r\n\r\nI am now concentrating my time, effort and experience on helping a team of highly talented and driven UX designers and researchers build out a suite of quality applications which meet the users and business requirements. As part of this I will be working very closely with the respective development teams who maintain the different applications.\r\n\r\nI am going to be leaning heavily on my 20+ years in IT / web related roles, as well as flexing my Accessibility muscles a **lot** more as we aim to get as much of the tooling as possible to WCAG 2.1 AA.\r\n"},{"id":1634338800,"title":"Testing times\r","author":"Ian\r","date":"October 16, 2021\r","icon":"bi-award\r","image":"testing-trophy.png\r","content":"\r\nIn a number of hobby projects I've been **banging my head** off the coding wall on how to tackle front end testing. I've been working in ReactJS a **lot**, for my projects, so decided to do a bit of research and I'm really glad I did.\r\n\r\nI found out about an amazingly talented developer called **Kent C. Dodds** and have been following his guidance on _what_ and _how to_ test things in JavaScript projects. So much so, in fact, that I got a Pro license for his incredible course at TestingJavaScript.com.\r\n\r\nHe covers everything from the **Fundamentals of testing** -> **Install, Configure, and Script Cypress for JavaScript Web Applications**.\r\n\r\nI've completed half of the sections so far and can honestly say it's changed the way I think about developing, let alone testing. I've not just learned about testing, I've also picked up a whole raft of tricks and tips on how to set up projects and my coding environment.\r\n\r\nI'm now using IntelliJ purely for Spring Boot and VS Code for all front end layer work.\r\n"},{"id":1604793600,"title":"(re)building the dream\r","author":"Ian\r","date":"November 08, 2020\r","icon":"bi-bricks\r","image":"lego-landrover.png\r","content":"\r\nlike everybody and their dog (if you're lucky enough to have one) I've been trying to do some bits'n'bobs around the place during the joy that is _lockdown_. this particular venture is the rehash of my Christmas present Lego Land Defender.\r\n\r\nI made an heroic effort to construct it first time round, completing it in a matter of 3 or 4 rationed days. however, the reason there is a **need** for a **re**build, is that mistakes were made. experience is a valuable asset and in this case I've learned some incredibly useful techniques for _future_ builds.\r\n\r\nthat said, it's not been entirely painless on v.2 attempt. some brilliantly timed interruptions from the kids, dinner, sleep and working from home all mean it's not finished yet. but from a feel-good point of view, it's really done me the world of good. it's not painting the Sistine Chapel / landscaping the garden, but my well-being is massively lifted and where is the harm in that ?\r\n"}]

              There are as many ways to do Single Page Applications (SPAs) as
              there are developers with opinions. Within my work we have many
              instances of AngularJS, Angular (4,5,6,7,9,11,12) and ReactJS.

              My experience with ReactJS began as pretty limited, but with a

              Before moving recently to pure UX team, I worked on a growing React platform which included multiple chart and grid offerings.

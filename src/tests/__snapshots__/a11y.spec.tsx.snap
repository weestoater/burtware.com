            <strong>
              really
            </strong>
             care about Accessibility (a11y) online and have done for over 20 years now.

            With a move to a new team in Sep '21, I've switched direction as a developer from being a delivery focused engineer, to working with teams as a SME 
            <small>
              (subject matter expert)
            </small>
             on UI development and more importantly Web Standards & A11Y.

            I believe in clean easy to read code, especially in my 
            <code>
              html
            </code>
            . As part of my day job I help teams building web applications to make sure they are accessible and I always start off by getting their developers to install the 
            <a
              href="https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/"
            >
              Axe Tools

             for Chrome.

             This simple tool can give a great insight into issues teams are facing on the journey to a11y compliance.  I especially like the fact that there are the four bandings:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Critial
            </li>
            <li>
              Serious
            </li>
            <li>
              Moderage
            </li>
            <li>
              Minor
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The ability to drill down on individual items and 
            <b>
              highlight
            </b>
             any offending code is brilliant and gets across the issues a lot better than any text book ever could.

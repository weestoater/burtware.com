                    <p>Angus and I had a couple of runs around the Culbin Forest this summer, whilst up in Nairn on holidays.</p>
                    
                    <p>The setup there is really top notch. OK, so itâ€™s not Glentress or Ae, but the Forestry Commission has got excellent facilities at the main car park, including a healthy supply of maps - <i>(cheers)</i>.</p>

                    <p>We did a nice wee loop to begin with, not like the epic all day beast Lisa and I did a few years back.  Then on the second visit, we did the Hill 99 route, which was excellent.</p>

                    <p>The only slight downers were my <b>incredibly squeaky disc brakes</b> on the descent from the hill and the fact you had to pay for parking.</p>

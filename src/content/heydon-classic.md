Heydon Pickering | Effortless Style | CSS Day from Web Conferences Amsterdam on [Vimeo](http://www.vimeo.com).

Classes, and the CSS methodologies based on them, have begot a component based approach to styling web pages. This results in a form of presentational markup that, despite breaking with the “separation of concerns” principle, has proven to be a popular approach to collaborating on style schemas. 

However, methodologies and standards are not equivalent and inviting the explicit prescription of CSS into the editorial process will quickly alienate non-developers charged with simply writing content. This session will explore ways to help content editors elicit stylistic nuances without having to think about design or CSS at all.

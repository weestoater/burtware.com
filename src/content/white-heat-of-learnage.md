So this week saw me return to ‘work’ after a few weeks off on holiday with the family. Fully enjoyed, rested and raring to go.

Happily though, it’s not a straight back to desk and heads down number. In fact, I’m in a training course for **three glorious days** in the sweltering heat of a Glasgow summer.

Ordinarily I’d not complain, but with fans buzzing around the room and temperatures that would put an insomniac to sleep – I’m struggling.

The course content and pace is pretty good too – though a little bit of leaning towards `TypeScript` which isn’t the way I’m thinking of going with React.

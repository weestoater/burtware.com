I recenlty purchased a cracking book to help me learn the joys of React.

I am happy to say it’s been a [hugely enjoyable experience](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/172004399X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

The book, unlike others I’ve read, has a central project which you take from the start right through the book. Each chapter offers further reading or examples to look at for personal research / deeper understanding. This was a surprise to begin with, but much used as the topics became more and more involved.

I’m really **really** happy with the end result and have a MUCH deeper insight into tackling things for my hobby and works projects. TDD isn’t covered in as much depth as I would have liked personally, but the examples given on testing do cover enough to give you a good jumping off point.

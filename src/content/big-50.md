So despite wishing it would never happen - my twin brother and I turned **50** recently.

We decided to do a wee trip together, after our respective families had suitably embarrassed us at seperate events.

I had a surprise (to me at least) trip to Aberfeldy, to visit the Dewars Distillery, then stayed over in the Loch Rannoch Hotel, very nice.

In the morning, I got lots of amazing gifts from my wife and kids, then another two surprises - a spa treatment that morning and a trip to my first ever 4x4 off-road experience venue, Highland Safari.  This time, instead of Lisa getting flung around the back of a Land Rover 110 it would be Angus, who was about 5 months old the last time I did this.

Needless to say everyone had a great time, Lisa and Orla did gold panning whilst Angus and I drove round like lunatics.

When it came to the twins trip away, we did ourselves proud.  A trip to the oldest distillery in Scotland and some incredible 4 x 4 offroad driving, with the incredibly patient and knowledgable Angus (76).

From the big cheesy grin my brother was sporting as we left the place - I'd say he **really** enjoyed it. At last he now sees for himself why I am so fascinated and addicted to these incredible machines.

Over the **many** years I have been developing websites few advancements have beat the change from `css` to pre-processors such as `sass` and `less`.

In the good old bad old days css was **highly** labour intensive and could often involve hours of repetitive tasks, when the clients invariably changed their minds on colour schemes, etc.

With the advent of pre-processors `variables` and `snippets` have made modular style css structures a massive improvement.

Couple that with the stunning frameworks of bootstrap and foundation things are really in a good place.

Certainly newbies wonâ€™t have to endure any of the table driven browser wars from the IE and Netscape days.

I just wish I had enough time to experiment and explore.

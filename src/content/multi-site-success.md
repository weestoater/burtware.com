As a **certified Umbraco Developer** I should really know better, but I am a very happy camper tonight.

My work is rolling out a couple of upgraded sites in v.7 of Umbraco, instead of their current v4.6.

Rather than duplicate a shed load of templates and copy, as only one or two sections are different, I decided in my infinite wisdom to make it a multi site instance. Well, the first site was a skoosh – battering through the doctypes and templates like the wind was in my sails. Only, to get sunk on the first `‘landing page’` of the second site. Sure the first site went well, but now on the second site it’s content was listing, with the first site beneath.

Much research later I was just about getting ready to go down the `site_1_template` & `site_2_template` route when I had a brain wave.

You’ll never guess what – it **actually worked**.

Superb, smashing great!

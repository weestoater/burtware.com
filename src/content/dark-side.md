After **several years** using Android phones I have chosen to go back to Apple. The reasoning is fairly simple and possibly misguided.

I’m using my works MacBook Pro more and more these days, so I’m going to try and eek out more of its’ productivity – i.e. joined-up-ness by utilising some of the ‘features’ of mac to mac devices.

There is a big **‘work’** shaped caveat to this, in that the MacBook Pro in question is **not** a factory install. Instead, a fair few elements have been removed and / or disabled.

Wish me luck I may well need it…

**Update**

> be careful what you wish for...

As suspected a LOT of the cool Mac functionality has indeed been locked down on the 'works' MacBook Pro. But that in itself is not too bad, as it's interfaces with the mobile apps I use for work are MUCH better.

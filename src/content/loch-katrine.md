AJ and I decided to go away for an overnight camping. I went online and found Loch Katrine campsite.

It mentioned the Steamship Sir Walter Scott and cycle routes down the side of the Loch from Stronachlachar.

> Booking made = chuffed x 2.

Then the biblical rain happened over the next few days, resulting in landslides that sadly closed off the cycle routes. But we soldiered on, drove up this morning, here nice and early, chose our tent pitch and did the Loch sailing.

Nipped into Callander for some supplies and got stuck behind a cycling event for what seemed like an eternity. Then made it back in perfect time to miss the rain but catch the midgies for pitching our tent.

We then hit the cafe for some shelter, as the rain wasn’t going to ease off any time soon. A bite to eat later and the weather calmed down enough for us to hit the road on the bikes. A great bit of road, nice a quiet, not too busy with other ‘tourists’ and a nice wee jaunt after dinner was had. Even took a wee breather by the viewpoint to soak up the amazing atmosphere – Gods country!

So I came back from holidays and started in a new team.

Same firm, building and floor – but different team, now I’m doing _UI Engineering for Automation_.

A whole new bunch of people in a brand new team. They are all awesome but it’s straight into the work and getting up to speed.

We have a real mix of backgrounds and experience, which is fantastic as it means there are loads of opportunities to share knowledge and grow as a team.

Wouldn’t have it any other way.

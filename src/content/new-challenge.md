As part of my personal development, through work, I’m going to try and gain some professional certification in the Cloud environment.

We have a corporate account with those wizards at Cloud Academy, so my first target will be to get AWS Developer certified.

We have a couple of different learning paths in work, which I’m happy to say I’ve already completed some of. So I should probably check to make sure I’m not skipping any vital steps / stages.

That said, I would like to get up-and-running on AWS asap, then start refactoring my suite of websites that I ‘host’ and ‘blog’ onto myself.

Would be nice to not be beholden to ISP’s when I could manage them myself, possibly a lot cheaper too.

What an amazingly relaxing and recharging time we all had. Cannot say fairer than that!

We ventured down to the Lake District for a break and I would definately recommend it to anyone.  Staying in the small town of Ambleside, we used it as a base for our activities - which were few and far between.  The heat was biblical, 34C plus on some days.

But days spent walking around the village, sampling local food and drink, playing crazy golf / pitch and putt /  tennis, were all HUGELY rewarding and despite the odd squabble about how many turns the player had taken, pretty relaxing too.

I particularly wanted to see the Bluebird exhibition, which was fascinating.  An extraordinary person Donald Campbell, I'm sure some folks will have their opinions on him, but I admire his drive, commitment and bravery.
Nobody has held the land and water speed records at the same time since he did, so that surely tells you something about the passion of the man.

The kids enjoyed a plunge into the Coniston Waters when we came back from our boat trip. Lisa and I enjoyed just sitting watching them play __'nicely'__ (for once). They even moaned when we said it was time to go.

We tried to get our daily **fix** of doggie time, as we'd decided not to take Buster with us.  This was a sound choice as the heat and number of other dogs was stiffling.  He wouldn't have been able to cope and that's not much of a break for him.  He's had a great time with Reece anyways so we all had a great time knowing he was being cared for and loved just us much (a.k.a. spoilt rotten).

The only __downside__ was the parking, a frequent and understandable grumble.  Locals were in the vast majority incredibly welcoming and kind.  Will be back again, maybe to a different part, but returning for sure.

Began my AngularJS training today and I’m surprised at how much I had already learned myself.

Whether it’s from the countless hours in front of Pluralsight videos or the even more hours in front of project code – I’m mildly chuffed to say the least.

It has exposed, however, the lack of JS skills I do have.  Simple logic appears to evade me at times, but then nearly drowns me when the flow begins.

Either way, it’s nice to be in the classroom and learning / reaffirming.

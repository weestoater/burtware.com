Wallowing in self-pity has become all too easy...

What with Cellulitus v2 (Cv2) reappearance and withdrawal of some important meds due to clashing with anti-biotics needed for treatment.

But just ‘cos I’m fat, over forty and ginger that doesn’t mean to say I should get away with it. There are a lot of folks a damned sight worse off than I who still manage to drag their backsides out of bed and get something of worth done each day.

So tubs – no more down down, deeper and down. Get your act together and make something useful of this time.

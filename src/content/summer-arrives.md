an absolutely **gorgeous** day in the garden today. 

started with some intense strimming and grass cutting - even managed to squeeze in cheeky wee mow of the neighbours garden too. which was nice.

but the fun really started when we began to look at putting some planters out to the front of the house.  AJ was a great assistant and managed to bag himself some quality pocket-money. The planters are looking the business now.

Buster had a great time just sniffing around and helping with the pots when he could.  He had a wee play with Bonnie, when Bobby came round to say hello, but other than that it was a nice shaded day for him.

finished off the day with a lovely burger and curly fries in the garden with the family.  Buster doing some world class mooching, but not burgers fell his way sadly.

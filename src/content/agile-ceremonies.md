Trying to be more disciplined at work with our **agile ceremonies**.  

They are a really important practice to help bridge some of the knowledge gaps in our team and the general concensus is that we’re doing well as a group.  With such a variety of work experience and coding backgrounds, it's hard to see sometimes how some people will work together as a pair, or in a 'mob'.

Our working habits are improving steadily, with tickets getting created per job, sized and now that we’ve got our unit testing dialled in the hope is to rock some **TDD** out of our next deliverables.

I’d like to get some CI pipeline elements in place, but the next ‘_agile thing_‘ I think we could benefit from would be continuous improvement. Setting ourselves a **definition of awesome** for the back end; front end and pipeline – would help us focus and maybe give us a chance to build in some continuous improvement into our sprints.

BAU still needs to be a large part of the sprints, but a backlog of improvement tasks might do us any harm.

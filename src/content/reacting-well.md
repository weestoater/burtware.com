I was recently tasked with building a ‘_dashboard_’, something else to learn.

So I hit my pluralsight tutorials and filled up on coffee.

I also decided to take the plunge into the React world, as this is in vogue at the moment. Must say I am pleasantly surprised at how much I was able to achieve.

I just need to get some **actual data** to use, then I can mock the heck out of this sucker.

Also managed to spark an idea for a Motherwell FC related side project.

Next challenge is to get my head around handling the data to power it all.

Still not a fan of _jsx_ mixed markup, but when in Rome…

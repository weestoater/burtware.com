So after many **MANY** years of mocking and undermining them, I am now the proud user of a MacBook Pro, for my sins.

As the _UX Architect/Engineer_ for my team I am tasked with a multitude of design related duties, wireframes, site maps, mockups etc.

The weapon of choice for the firm is the MBP with Sketch and Adobe CC. I am really liking Sketch as a tool and the difference in Adobe too.

But most of all I love the speed and simplicity of the MacBook itself. Git, npm, bash all run insanely fast. Code seems to compile faster too, even though I swore I wouldn’t put Java and IntelliJ on it.

All I need now is to lose a few stones, dye my beard and start wearing polo necks…

Finally managed to get a date arranged to meet up with the **Silver Fox** to go see the highly acclaimed "Top Gun: Maverick".

Lisa is **NOT** a _huge_ fan of the _pint-sized_ Mr. T Cruise, but I **love** the flight sequences - especially military aircraft ones like this. Between Top Gun and Firefox, with Clint Eastwood, I'm pretty much dying for the ariel footage.

I'm delighted to say we got good seats, in a pretty quiet screening, despite the technology and a '**sick-note**' from the young girl on the till.

Loved the film - absolutely loved it. Corny in places, totally HOLLYWOOD in fact, but exactly what was needed after a pretty zoned out day in front of a keyboard.

Great chance to catch-up with a good good friend and enjoy each others nonsense for a while.

> You can be my wingman anytime Silver Fox!

Will have to watch the original again, then go and see Maverick one more time on the big screen.

I wanted to get an AWS instance up and running, as quickly as possible. So I have used AWS Amplify to power this project. At the moment, I have it set to build and deploy from my github instance and apart from some 'minor' issues in the beginning, it has been fairly pain free.

There are some great tutorials on setting up testing as part of the deploy process so that will probably be where I begin to focus my time in the near future.

Right now I just want to add some more 'content' and get it working smoothly as a process.

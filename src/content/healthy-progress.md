As part of the learning path towards Cloud Developer certification, I’ve decided to invest in `React` as my chosen UI/UX Framework.

The firm I work for has a great deal of projects using it and there is a clear cross over from my previous experience in `AngularJS` / `Angular`.

I’m really happy with the work I’ve managed to achieve so far, thanks to the Pluralsight and some books I’ve managed to borrow from colleagues.

There are some simple differences I’ve enjoyed already, but some things are taking a little longer to sink in. Getting old I guess.

I have been lucky enough to work on a properly cool project as part of my day-job that involves adding a `markdown` blog to an existing application.

I looked at a bunch of options, but eventually settled on the aptly name [react-markdown package](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown).

I was also able to find a really good series of videos on youtube and sat down to put what I could into place.

It was a really interesting and practical piece, as I can actually see the benefit of using this methodology instead of other `RSS feed` based alternatives.

I'm now debating as to whether or not to implement it on this site, instead of using traditional `.tsx` files with mark-up.

## update - 06/06/22

well I bit the bullet and have implemented a `markdown` solution for the blog element of this site now. I'm **super** pleased with it, as it's everything I wanted it to be and it allows me the opportunity
to migrate all the old posts from my personal site over to this and dial down my hosting fees.

I have been lucky enough to work on a properly cool project as part of my day-job that involves adding a `markdown` blog to an existing application. I looked at a bunch of options, but eventually settled on the aptly name [react-markdown package](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown).

I was also able to find a really good series of videos on youtube and sat down to put what I could into place.

It was a really interesting and practical piece, as I can actually see the benefit of using this methodology instead of other `RSS feed` based alternatives.

I'm now debating as to whether or not to implement it on this site, instead of using traditional `.tsx` files with mark-up.

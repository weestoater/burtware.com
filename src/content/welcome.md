This is my little play pen for ReactJs and AWS hobby projects. I'm hoping to add some experiments with ReactJs and other stuff soon. But like all good 'blog' type projects, this is very much a side-of-desk effort from home.

There are so many things happening in work that coming home and battering stuff into a 'blog' might be the very last thing I end up doing, but I'm going to try and treat this as more of an experimental zone.

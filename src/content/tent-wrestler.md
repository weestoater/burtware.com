So I thought I’d have a quick look at the _‘pop-up’_ tent so AJ and I could maybe boost for a day or two.

Well, it certainly **‘pops’** out of the bag. Discovered it was missing the pegs it should have had – thanks to ebay that’s now resolved.

So happy with it’s condition and specification, needed to put it back in its’ wee bag. Thus began the fun and games. Should just be a little fold here and a tuck in there. How wrong can one man be…

After a good **ten minutes** of no success. I threw in the towel and hit me googles. Praise be to youtube and the healing powers of watching someone who knows what they’re doing…

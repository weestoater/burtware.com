Enjoying a period of constant learning right now.

Whether it’s about the Jenkins build I’m trying to set up; using JS prototypes for handling a data model or just getting under the bonnet with some AngularJS – everything is all bright and sparkling.

It’s just as refreshing to return to something that I’d consider my staple diet, such as some Bootstrap stuff.  Putting the designs into Angular + Bootstrap project never gets boring – it is an opportunity to learn; finesse and refactor as we go.

What’s not to like.
